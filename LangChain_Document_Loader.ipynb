            " Welcome to Machine Learning. What is machine learning? You probably use it many times a day without even knowing it. Anytime you want to find out something like, how do I make a sushi roll? You can do a web search on Google bingo by do to find out. And that works so well because the machine learning software has figured out how to rank web pages.  Or when you upload pictures to Instagram or Snapchat and think to yourself, I want to talk to my friends so they can see their pictures. Well, these apps can recognize your friends and your pictures and label them as well. That's also machine learning. Or if you've just finished watching a Star Wars movie on the video streaming service and you think, what are the similar movies that I watch?  Well, the streaming service will likely use machine learning to recommend something that you might like. Each time you use voice attacks on your phone to write a text message, Hey Andrew, how's it going? Or tell your phone, hey Siri, play a song by Riha\n"
